# What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site.
# Advice on choosing the best text editor
## Most important features in text editor: 
1. code completion 
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. 

## The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer
On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text
editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of
your particular distribution
## Third-Party Options
### NotePad++
NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only.
NotePad++ has been around for many years and many web
developers swear by NotePad++. It has syntax highlighting and code
completion, as well as word completion and function completion. It
has a zoom in an out feature, it’s own online community, and its own
chat room for questions that may arise. It even has its own searchable
wiki page for more assistance.
### TextWrangler/BB Edit
TextWrangler is for Mac computers only, and you used to be able to
download it from the Mac App Store. In doing my research for this
blog post, I’ve come to find out that TextWrangler has been retired. I
know, I’m a little late to the party with this news, but TextWrangler
was retired in 2017. This was one of the go-to text editors for Mac
Computers.
But all hope is not lost, the folks that make TextWrangler, Bare Bones
Software has incorporated TextWrangler into its more robust, big
brother, BB Edit—another feature packed text editor.
### BB Edit 
BB Edit is software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30-
day free trial. After the 30 days is over, if you still want the free
version, simply continue using BB Edit, and you’ll get the same
features as you would have gotten in TextWrangler. If you want the
full features in BB Edit, the full cost for a full license is $49.99. Find

### Visual Studio Code (My personal favorite)
Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the
web developing community
### Atom
Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows
computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. Atom is brought to
you by the folks at GitHub . GitHub is a great service online where
you can host and review code, or you can post and get help with the
development of your own projects. Atom also ticks all the right boxes.
It has syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, the works! Atom is
definitely a software to check out and test drive for yourself.
### Brackets
Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for
Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. It’s made
and maintained by the good folks at Adobe—yep, the Photoshop
people. Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though
more coding capabilities can be added through extensions. Being that
Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this might be a
great choice to start with. But still the choice is yours.
Brackets includes all of the features one may want when using a text
editor including something called “Live Preview” which updates your
website once you make a change automatically. So, you can’t go
wrong with Brackets
### Sublime Text
Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full
for $70. Otherwise you’ll use the free version. Sublime Text enjoys a
history of being fast and responsive while being extensible as well.
There’s no doubt that Sublime Text will tick the check boxes of what
to look for in a text editor. It has syntax highlighting, it has code
completion, it has themes and extensions. And will definitely get the
job done no matter how advanced you get with your coding....just to name a few!
## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
